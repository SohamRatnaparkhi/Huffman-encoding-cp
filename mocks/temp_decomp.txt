The utility class Files in the java.nio.file package provides the following methods for reading and writing binary data:
readAllBytes(Path path): reads all bytes from a file and returns an array of bytes. This method is intended for reading small files, not large ones.
write(Path path, byte[] bytes, OpenOption... options): writes an array of bytes to a file with some useful options like CREATE, TRUNCATE_EXISTING, WRITE and APPEND.
Note that both methods close the input and output file after done and throw IOException in case of error.
